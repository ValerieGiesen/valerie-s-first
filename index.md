## You Should `Not` Be Seeing This

Valerie **never** thought she would be interested in coding. She managed high-school maths alright, 
but really got into languages at school. She has studied Latin, Arabic, English, Spanish, French and, 
most usefully, Ancient Greek. 
She is also an anthropologist, baking enthusiast and editor.

She currently lives in Geneva where she questions the philosophical and practical merits of [Weber's Protestant Ethic](https://moderntheories.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/max-weber-the-protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-capitalism/) at the shores of beautiful Lake Geneva, in the heartland of Calvinism. 

### More to the point, here is a `list of reasons` Valerie would like to learn how to code:

1. To bring more concrete 'know-how' to social justice and political work.
2. For the love of learning languages.
3. To better understand the impact of (future) technology of on our lives.
4. For the love of making things, fiddling around, solving problems.
